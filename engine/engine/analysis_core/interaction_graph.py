"""Stage 7 — interaction peer expansion (pure helpers).

For a recommended workload, the runner walks its outgoing dependency edges, recovers
each peer's Signal, and asks these functions two things: does the peer share the same
period, and do their active windows line up in time? If both hold, the peer is suggested
alongside the primary recommendation. These functions also feed the target heuristic:
inbound traffic that fires during a workload's *idle* windows marks it as "ad-hoc"
(scale-to-zero rather than a fixed schedule). No DB access here — the runner loads data.
